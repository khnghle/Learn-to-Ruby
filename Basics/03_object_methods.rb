# Method is a message you send to the object that instructs it to do something (some sort of command)

# String object method
# .length (length of string) .upcase (to uppercase) .downcase (to lowercase) .inspect (shows literal view so for string it shows quotes p = string.inspect)

# Number object method
# .next (increment by one) .to_s (convert to string)

# nil (nothing is returned from function, but if puts shows up as LITERALLY nothing)

# Method calls are optional 
p 1.next() # equivalent as 1.next 
  # parenthesis is omitted if no argument is needed 
  # actually parenthesis are optional in ruby 
  
    #All same 
      # 10 - 5
      # 10.-(5)
      # 10.-5
